Welcome to my blog! My name is Jelica and I am Teaching Assistant at Faculty of Organizational Sciences. This will be the place where I am going to share additional materials (not mandatory for passing exams) for Mobile App Development and Computer Networks courses that I teach.
Do not hesitate to contact me if you have a question or need some help with presented materials. You can email me at jelica.stanojevic@fon.bg.ac.rs.
